All about HTML , CSS and JavaScript HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are three fundamental technologies used in web development.

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating the structure and content of web pages. It provides a set of tags that define the various elements on a web page such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more. HTML acts as the backbone of a web page, organizing and presenting the information.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. It enables developers to control the appearance and layout of multiple web pages at once by defining styles for various elements. CSS allows customization of colors, fonts, spacing, borders, and other visual aspects, enhancing the overall design and user experience.

JavaScript is a versatile programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It runs on the client-side, meaning it is executed by the user's web browser. JavaScript enables developers to create interactive elements, handle user input, validate forms, manipulate and modify HTML and CSS, make API calls, and perform various actions in response to events. It plays a crucial role in creating engaging and interactive web applications.

Together, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form the foundation of modern web development. HTML defines the structure, CSS enhances the visual presentation, and JavaScript brings life and interactivity to web pages. These three technologies work in harmony to create compelling, user-friendly, and responsive websites and web applications
